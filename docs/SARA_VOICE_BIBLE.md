# Sara Voice Bible

## Status: LOCKED

Sara's voice is a core locked asset.

Do not replace the approved voice model.

Voice issues must be solved through better scripts, better wording, and better speech direction — never by switching voice models.

## Approved Voice Profile

### Current Status

**Sync note (2026-07-02):** Sara's voice is bundled into her approved Character Production inside Veo — it is not a separate external TTS model. This is a documentation sync gap, not an open decision: the line below ("not yet formally selected") predates confirmation of the Veo Character system and is now out of date.

What is confirmed from the Veo Character Info: Sara speaks with a natural local Jeddawi accent, as someone born and raised in Jeddah — matching the Accent Preservation Rules below. No separate voice model name, platform, or ID applies, since the voice is native to the Veo Character rather than a swappable external asset.

**Still open:** this Character Info describes voice *style* (accent, natural delivery), not measurable audio criteria. The Voice Approval Criteria checklist below has not yet been run against an actual Veo-generated sample. Do this before treating pronunciation/phonemic accuracy as confirmed — see Priority Experiments in `docs/veo/SARA_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`.

**Strategic implication worth confirming with the user:** if voice is native to the Veo Character (not a separate step), this may resolve the still-open "native Veo dialogue vs. audio replacement" decision (`docs/veo/SARA_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`) in favor of native dialogue — but this should be confirmed explicitly, not assumed from this document alone.

### Voice Approval Criteria

A voice is approved when it passes all of the following tests:

**Character match:**
- [ ] Sounds like a Saudi woman — not Gulf, not Egyptian, not neutral MSA
- [ ] Has natural warmth — not cold, not overly professional
- [ ] Does not sound like a virtual assistant or news reader
- [ ] The character feels personal, not performed

**Phonemic accuracy:**
- [ ] ع (ayn) — clearly and naturally rendered, not reduced to a plain vowel sound
- [ ] ح (heavy h) — distinct from هـ (light h), not merged
- [ ] ق (qaf) — soft or near-glottal, as in Hejazi speech, not heavy Najdi
- [ ] ج (jeem) — clean "j" sound, not "g" (Gulf) or hard "g" (Egyptian)
- [ ] Shaddah (ّ) — double consonants are audible and natural, not reduced to single

**Natural delivery test:**

Read this test sentence and evaluate:
```
وصلت البلد القديم الساعة ستة الصبح. ما كان فيه أحد. بس هذا اللي بغيته.
```

The voice passes if:
* Each sentence ends naturally with a slight fall in pitch
* "البلد القديم" sounds correct — not "Al-Bald" or "Al-Qadim"
* "بغيته" sounds Hejazi and natural, not formally read

**Longevity test:**
- [ ] Listen to 5 minutes of continuous output — the voice does not fatigue the ear
- [ ] Voice character is consistent from start to finish with no drift

## Voice Character

Sara's voice should feel like:
* A real person talking, not reading.
* A friend telling a story, not a narrator.
* Calm and warm, not excited or anchored.

### Qualities to Preserve

| Quality          | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Warmth           | The voice feels close and personal                   |
| Clarity          | Words are easy to understand without effort          |
| Naturalness      | The pace and rhythm sound like real speech           |
| Calm confidence  | Not nervous, not overly enthusiastic                 |
| Hejazi softness  | The characteristic gentle flow of Jeddah Arabic      |

---

## Speech Direction

### Pace

* Moderate pace. Not rushed. Not overly slow.
* Allow natural pauses between sentences.
* Pause longer before important moments or reveals.
* Planning target: approximately 100–120 Arabic words per minute including natural pauses.
* Note: verify this rate against actual approved voice output before finalizing script length calculations.

### Rhythm

* Vary sentence length to create natural rhythm.
* Short sentence. Then a slightly longer one. Then short again.
* Avoid long unbroken stretches of identical sentence length.
* A sentence of three words can carry more weight than a sentence of fifteen.

### Tone per Context

| Context                  | Tone Direction                              |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Opening a new place      | Curious, slightly elevated energy           |
| Describing history       | Focused, calm, deliberate                   |
| Meeting locals / culture | Warm, engaged, genuine                      |
| Closing / reflection     | Thoughtful, grounded, personal              |
| Surprising discovery     | Natural wonder — not exaggerated            |

## Pronunciation Rules

### Critical Arabic Phonemes

These sounds are commonly mishandled by AI voice models in Arabic. Monitor each in every episode.

| Sound | Correct (Hejazi) | Common AI Error | Fix |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|-----|
| ع (ayn) | Full, voiced, pharyngeal | Reduced to plain vowel | Flag for review; keep the word |
| ح (heavy h) | Breathy, distinct from هـ | Merged with هـ | Avoid pairing both sounds in the same short sentence |
| ق (qaf) | Soft / near-glottal in Hejazi | Heavy Najdi or formal "q" | If consistently wrong, rewrite to avoid the word |
| ج (jeem) | Clean "j" | "g" sound (Gulf) | Flag and keep; retrain with script marker if needed |
| شدة (shaddah) | Audible double consonant | Reduced to single | If merged, rewrite to avoid the word |
| ة (ta marbuta) | Silent at phrase-final in Hejazi | Pronounced "t" | Restructure sentence to remove ة from emphasis position |

### Place Name Pronunciation Guide

Write place names exactly as shown in all scripts. Do not vary the spelling between episodes.

| Place | Script Form | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Al-Balad (historic district) | البلد القديم | Full form on first use per episode |
| Jeddah | جدة | No tashkeel unless voice misreads |
| Rawasheen | الرواشين | Plural of روشن. Introduce with explanation on first use. |
| Red Sea | البحر الأحمر | Always full form |
| Corniche | الكورنيش | Accepted loanword — use as is |
| Al-Shallal | الشلال | |

### Numbers in Scripts

Never write numerals in scripts. Always write numbers as full Arabic words.

| Avoid | Use |
|-------|-----|
| ١٠٠٠ or 1000 | ألف |
| ١٩٢٦ or 1926 | ألف وتسعمية وستة وعشرين |
| ١٤ مليون | أربعة عشر مليون |
| ٦ صباحاً | الساعة ستة الصبح |
| الساعة ١٠ | الساعة عشرة |

For historical context, prefer relative time over specific years:
* Use: "من أكثر من ألف سنة"
* Avoid: "في عام تسعمية ميلادي"

---

## Tashkeel Guidance

Tashkeel (diacritical vowel marks) can improve AI voice pronunciation for ambiguous or unfamiliar words.

### When to Add Tashkeel

Add tashkeel only when:
* A word has two common pronunciations with different meanings and context does not resolve the ambiguity
* A proper noun or historical term is being mispronounced by the voice model
* A specific word has caused mispronunciation in a previous episode

### When Not to Add Tashkeel

Do not add tashkeel to:
* Common everyday words — the model handles these reliably
* Colloquial Hejazi words — tashkeel forces MSA pronunciation and breaks the accent
* Sentence-final positions — tanween (ً ٍ ٌ) triggers formal MSA delivery; avoid in all natural speech sentences
* Connectors and particles: بس، يعني، وبعدين، إيش — leave these unmarked always

### Tashkeel Examples

Appropriate:
```
الرَّواشين   — clarifies pronunciation of this specific architectural term
البَلَد القديم  — if the model reads البِلاد instead of البَلَد
```

Inappropriate:
```
بَس          — tashkeel causes formal MSA tone, use: بس
يَعْني        — same issue, use: يعني
صَراحةً       — tanween ending forces formal delivery, use: صراحة
```

## Accent Preservation Rules

Sara's accent is Hejazi Arabic — the dialect of Jeddah.

This accent is part of her identity and must be consistent across all content.

### Hejazi Characteristics to Preserve

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Gentle rhythm | Softer and more melodic than Najdi or Gulf Arabic |
| Jeem (ج) | Pronounced "j" — never "g" |
| Qaf (ق) | Soft or near-glottal — not the heavy Najdi "q" |
| Ta marbuta (ة) | Typically silent at the end of natural speech phrases |
| Connectors | بس، يعني، إيش، وبعدين — these carry Hejazi accent identity |
| Contractions | هالـ (this + noun), هذي (this, fem.) — Hejazi natural forms |

### What Breaks the Accent

If any of the following appear in voice output, the script needs revision before re-generation:

* Heavy formal MSA pronunciation throughout a sentence
* Gulf "g" sound for ج
* Egyptian "إيه" or "أيوه" style affirmatives in Sara's voice
* Tanween endings rendered formally in emotional key lines
* Over-precise letter-by-letter delivery as if reading classical text

### Quick Accent Test Words

Use these as a spot-check at the start of any new session with the voice model:

| Word | What to Hear | What to Reject |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| إيش | "esh" — quick, natural | Slow or formal delivery |
| بس | "bass" — light, brief | Heavy emphasis like فقط |
| يعني | natural, flowing | Slow, MSA-formal "ya'ni" |
| هالمكان | "hal-makan" — contracted | "hatha al-makan" — over-articulated |
| بغيته | natural Hejazi past | Formal "أردته" delivery |

---

## Common Voice Problems and Fixes

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Sounds like reading, not talking | Shorten sentences. Add connectors: يعني، بس، وبعدين. |
| Unnatural pauses | Rewrite to match natural speech rhythm. Check sentence endings. |
| Over-pronounced formal words | Replace formal word with Hejazi conversational equivalent. |
| Flat delivery on key moments | Add beat markers or pacing notes in the script. |
| Rushed ending | Add a closing reflection sentence with `[long pause]` before it. |
| Wrong ق accent | Replace the word if possible; accept and flag if not. |
| ة pronounced as "t" | Restructure sentence so ة is not in an emphasis or final position. |
| Tanween sounds formal | Rewrite to avoid tanween endings in all key script lines. |
| Shaddah reduced | Avoid the word; rewrite using a synonym or restructured phrase. |

---

## Script Markers for Voice

Use these markers in scripts to guide voice generation. Place inside square brackets immediately before the relevant word or sentence.

| Marker | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `[pause]` | Brief natural pause |
| `[long pause]` | Longer pause for emotional weight or revelation |
| `[warm]` | Shift to warmer, closer tone |
| `[focus]` | Shift to deliberate, clear delivery |
| `[wonder]` | Natural curiosity — not exaggerated surprise |
| `[slow]` | Reduce pace for emphasis |
| `[question]` | Rising inflection for rhetorical questions |
| `[intimate]` | Very close, personal, quiet delivery |

Example:
```
وصلت هنا من غير توقع. [pause] ما كنت أعرف إن المكان راح يأثر فيّ بهالطريقة. [long pause] لكن هذا ما يصير أحياناً في السفر. [slow] الأماكن اللي ما خططت لها — هي اللي تفضل معك.
```

Use markers sparingly. One or two per paragraph is enough. Too many markers disrupt natural delivery.

## What to Avoid

* Do not change the voice model to fix a script problem — fix the script.
* Do not use voice effects or post-processing that changes the voice character.
* Do not allow the voice to sound artificial or robotic in any episode.
* Do not speed up or slow down the voice at the export/track level — fix pacing in the script.
* Do not add tashkeel to colloquial Hejazi words — it triggers MSA delivery.
* Do not end important lines with tanween — it forces formal pronunciation.
* Do not accept wrong ج pronunciation — flag and investigate before publishing.
